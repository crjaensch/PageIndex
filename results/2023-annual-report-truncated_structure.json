      "summary": "The partial document covers the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and economic developments in 2023, based on excerpts from the Monetary Policy Reports published in March and June 2023. It emphasizes the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Key points include a continued easing of inflation, which remains above the 2% target but has declined significantly without triggering a sharp rise in unemployment. The labor market remains tight with low unemployment and high job vacancies, and GDP growth has been strong, supported by consumer spending. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held the federal funds rate steady since July 2023, viewing the current rate range as likely the peak for this tightening cycle. The Fed continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The committee highlights a cautious but balanced outlook on employment and inflation risks, emphasizing its firm commitment to returning inflation to 2%. Future rate adjustments will depend on incoming data and risk assessments, with no rate reductions anticipated until sustained progress toward the inflation target is assured. The document also notes the semiannual reporting and Congressional testimonies as mandated by law."

Consumer price inflation has slow ed notably but remains abo ve 2 percent. The price\nindex for per sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 2.4 percent o ver the 12 months ending in\nJanuar y, down from a peak of 7.1 percent in 2022. The core PCE price index\u2014which excludes\nvolatile food and energ y prices and is gener-\nally considered a better guide to the direction\nof future inflation\u2014rose 2.8 percent in the\n12 months ending in Januar y, and the slowing\nin inflation w as widespread across both goods\nand ser vices prices ( figure 2.1 ). More recently ,\ncore PCE prices increased at an annual rate of\n2.5 percent o ver the six months ending in\nJanuar y, though measuring inflation o ver rela-\ntively shor t periods risks exaggerating the\ninfluence of idiosyncratic or temporar y factor s.\nMeasures of longer-ter m inflation expectations\nare within the range of values seen in the\ndecade before the pandemic and continue to\nbe broadly consistent with the FOMC\u2019 s\nlonger-r un objective of 2 percent.\nThe labor mar ket.The labor mar ket has\nremained relatively tight, with job gains a ver-\naging 239,000 per month since June and the\nunemplo yment rate near historical lows\n(figure 2.2 ). Labor demand has eased\u2014as job\nopenings ha ve declined in man y sector s of the\neconom y\u2014but continues to exceed the supply\nof available wor kers (figure 2.3 ). Labor supply\nhas trended higher o ver the past year ,\nreflecting a continued strong pace of immigra-\ntion and increases in the labor force par ticipa-\ntion rate, particular ly among prime-age\nworkers. Reflecting the impro ved balance\nbetween labor demand and supply , nominal\nwage gains slow ed in 2023, but the y remain\nabove a pace consistent with 2 percent infla-\ntion o ver the longer ter m, given pre vailing\ntrends in productivity growth.Figure 2.1.

Consumer spending gre w\nat a solid pace, and housing mar ket activity star ted to tur n back up in the second half of last year\nafter ha ving declined since ear ly 2021. How ever, real business fixed in vestment growth slow ed,\nlikely reflecting tighter financial conditions and downbeat business sentiment. In contrast to GDP ,\nmanufacturing output was little changed, on net, last year, a downshift following two years of\nrobust post-pandemic gains.\nFinancial conditions. Conditions in financial mar kets tightened considerably fur ther o ver the\nsummer and ear ly fall before re versing cour se tow ard the end of the year . The FOMC raised the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate a fur ther 25 basis points at its meeting last July , bringing\nthe overall increase in the target range for this tightening cycle to 525 basis points. The mar ket-\nimplied expected path of the federal funds rate has mo ved up, on net, since the middle of 2023,\nand yields on longer-ter m nominal T reasur y securities are notably higher on balance. Credit\nremains generally a vailable to most households and businesses but at ele vated interest rates,\nwhich ha ve weighed on financing activity . Lending b y banks to households and businesses slow ed\nnotably since June as banks continued to tighten standards and demand for loans softened.Figure 2.3.

Upw ard pressure on asset valuations continued, with real estate prices ele vated relative to\nrents and high price-to-ear nings ratios in equity mar kets. Bor rowing from nonfinancial businesses\nand households continued to increase at a pace slow er than that of nominal GDP , and the com-\nbined debt-to-GDP ratio now sits close to its 20-year low. Vulnerabilities from financial-sector\nleverage remain notable. While risk-based bank capital ratios stayed solid and increased broadly,\ndeclines in the fair values of fixed-rate assets have been sizable relative to the regulatory capital\nat some banks. Meanwhile, leverage at hedge funds has stabilized at high levels, and leverage at\nlife insurers increased to values close to the historical averages but with a liability composition\nthat has become more reliant on nontraditional sources of funding. Most banks maintained high\nliquidity and stable funding, while bank funding costs continue to increase.

      "summary": "The partial document provides a comprehensive review of U.S. monetary policy and economic developments in 2023, based on Federal Reserve reports from March 2024 and June 2023. Key points include:\n\n1. Inflation Trends: Inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's 2% target but has eased significantly over the past year. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also slowed, with longer-term inflation expectations consistent with the 2% goal.\n\n2. Labor Market: The labor market stayed tight with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Labor demand has softened slightly but still exceeds supply, while labor force participation increased due to factors like immigration. Wage growth slowed but remains above levels consistent with the inflation target.\n\n3. Economic Growth: Real GDP grew strongly by 3.1% in 2023, driven by solid consumer spending and a rebound in housing activity, though business investment growth slowed and manufacturing was flat.\n\n4. Financial Conditions: Financial markets tightened mid-year but eased by year-end. The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate steady at 5.25-5.5% since July 2023, viewing this rate as likely the peak for this tightening cycle, while also reducing its holdings of Treasury and agency securities.\n\n5. Financial Stability: The banking system remains resilient despite decreased stress since early 2023. Some risks remain in asset valuations and leverage in hedge funds and insurers. Bank liquidity stays high, though funding costs have risen.\n\n6. International Developments: Foreign economic growth slowed in the second half of 2023, especially in advanced economies and China, affected by tight monetary policy and structural challenges. Many foreign central banks paused rate hikes or began easing policy.\n\n7. Monetary Policy Outlook: The Federal Reserve is committed to achieving the 2% inflation target and will closely monitor data and risks before adjusting the federal funds rate further. It plans to slow and eventually stop balance sheet reductions when reserve levels align with policy needs.\n\n8. Special Topics: The document highlights improvements in employment and wages for disadvantaged demographic groups amid a historically tight labor market, though disparities persist. It also discusses housing market dynamics shaped by high mortgage rates, low inventory, and shifts in construction activity.\n\n9. Other Considerations: The report briefly addresses the Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing balance sheet runoff, developments in money markets, and the relevance of simple monetary policy rules, which currently align with the existing policy rate.\n\nOverall, the document outlines a cautiously optimistic economic outlook with inflation easing, steady employment, continued economic growth, and balanced risks amid ongoing monetary tightening and financial stability monitoring."

      "text": "June 2023 Summar y\nAlthough inflation has moderated some what since the middle of last year , it remains w ell abo ve\nthe Federal Open Mar ket Committee\u2019 s (FOMC) objective of 2 percent. The labor mar ket continues\nto be ver y tight, with robust job gains and the unemplo yment rate near historically low le vels,\nthough nominal w age growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies ha ve declined.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) growth w as modest in the fir st quar ter, despite a pickup in con-\nsumer spending . Bringing inflation back to 2 percent will lik ely require a period of below-trend\ngrowth and some softening of labor mar ket conditions.\nIn response to high inflation, the FOMC continued to increase interest rates and reduce its securi-\nties holdings. The FOMC has raised the target range for the federal funds rate a fur ther 75 basis\npoints since the star t of the year , bringing the range to 5 to 5\u00bc percent. In deter mining the extent\nof additional policy fir ming that ma y be appropriate to retur n inflation to 2 percent o ver time, the\nFOMC indicated that it will tak e into account the cumulative tightening of monetar y policy , the lags\nwith which monetar y policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial\ndevelopments. The F ederal Reser ve also continued to reduce its holdings of T reasur y and agency\nmortgage-back ed securities; these holdings ha ve declined b y about $420 billion since Januar y, fur-\nther tightening financial conditions.\nThe F ederal Reser ve is acutely a ware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially\non those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials. The FOMC is strongly committed to\nreturning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic and F inancial De velopments\nInflation. Consumer price inflation, as measured b y the 12-month change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 4.4 percent in April, down from its peak of\n7.0 percent last June but still w ell abo ve the FOMC\u2019 s 2 percent objective. Core PCE price\ninflation\u2014which excludes volatile food and energ y prices and is generally considered a better\nguide to the direction of future inflation\u2014is also off its peak but w as still 4.7 percent o ver the\n12 months ending in April. As supply chain bottlenecks ha ve eased and demand has stabilized,\nincreases in core goods prices slow ed considerably o ver the past year . Within core ser vices prices,\nhousing ser vices inflation has been high, but the monthly changes ha ve star ted to ease in recent\nmonths, consistent with the slow er increases in rents for ne w tenants that ha ve been obser ved\nsince the second half of last year . For other core ser vices, price inflation remains ele vated and has\nnot shown signs of easing , and prospects for slowing inflation ma y depend in par t on a fur ther\neasing of tight labor mar ket conditions.

Labor demand has eased in man y sector s of the econom y but continues to exceed\nthe supply of a vailable wor kers, with job vacancies still ele vated. Labor supply has impro ved, with\na pickup in immigration and an impro vement in the labor force par ticipation rate, particular ly\namong prime-age wor kers. Nominal w age gains continued to slow in the fir st half of 2023, but the y\nremain abo ve the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation o ver the longer ter m, given pre vailing\ntrends in productivity growth.\nEconomic activity .After the strong rebound in 2021 from the pandemic-induced recession, eco-\nnomic activity lost momentum last year , and growth in the fir st quar ter of this year w as modest as\nfinancial conditions continued to tighten. Real consumer spending gre w at a solid pace in the fir st\nquarter but appear s to be moderating as consumer financing conditions ha ve tightened and con-\nsumer confidence has remained low . Real business fixed in vestment growth continued to slow in\nthe fir st quar ter, likely reflecting tighter financial conditions and w eaker output growth, while manu-\nfacturing output has been roughly unchanged so far this year after ha ving declined in the four th\nquarter. Activity in the housing sector continued to contract in response to ele vated mor tgage\nrates, but se veral indicator s appear to ha ve bottomed out.\nFinancial conditions. Financial conditions ha ve tightened fur ther since Januar y. The FOMC has\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate a fur ther 75 basis points since Januar y, and the\nmarket-implied expected path of the federal funds rate o ver the next year shifted up. Though yields\non longer-ter m nominal T reasur y securities w ere little changed, on net, over this period, the rela-\ntively high le vel of interest rates has w eighed on financing activity . Business loans at banks gre w\nsince the star t of 2023, but the pace of growth continued to slow as banks tightened standards\nand a verage bor rowing costs rose. In vestment-grade cor porate bond issuance rebounded to a\nbrisk pace in Ma y, following a slowdown in March and April. Speculative-grade issuance rebounded\nas well but w as still subdued b y historical standards. While business credit quality remains strong ,\nsome indicator s of future business defaults are some what ele vated. F or households, mortgage\noriginations remained w eak, although consumer loans (such as auto loans and credit cards) gre w\nfurther. After ha ving risen last year , delinquency rates le veled off in the fir st quar ter for auto loans\nand continued to increase for credit card loans.\nFinancial stability .Despite concer ns about profitability at some banks, the banking system\nremains sound and resilient. Most measures of valuation pressures in cor porate securities mar-\nkets remained near the middle of their historical distributions. By contrast, valuation pressures in10 110th Annual Repor t | 2023commercial and residential real estate mar kets continued to be ele vated. Bor rowing b y house-\nholds and businesses gre w a bit more slowly than GDP , leaving vulnerabilities arising from house-\nhold and business debt largely unchanged at moderate levels. In the banking sector, heavy reli-\nance on uninsured deposits, declining fair values of long-duration fixed-rate assets associated with\nhigher interest rates, and poor risk management led to the failure of three domestic banks. Broad\nbank equity prices fell sharply as market participants reassessed the strength of some banks with\nsimilar risk profiles to those that failed. However, the broader banking sector maintained substan-\ntial loss-absorbing capacity and ample liquidity. In the nonbank financial sector, leverage at hedge\nfunds remained elevated, and structural vulnerabilities associated with funding risk persisted at\nsome money market funds and certain mutual funds.

Following a slowdown at the end of 2022, foreign activity rebounded\nearly this year . This rebound w as driven in par t by strong growth in China, as the lifting of\nCOVID-19 restrictions unleashed pent-up demand, though recent indicator s suggest that\nmomentum is slowing . Europe show ed resilience to the energ y price shock stemming from Rus-\nsia\u2019s war against Ukraine. F oreign headline inflation continued to fall, driven b y declines in retail\nenerg y prices. How ever, while energ y inflation has moderated in man y foreign economies, both\nfood and core inflation remain ele vated.\nSince Januar y, several major foreign central banks continued tightening their monetar y policies,\ncommunicating concer ns about ele vated inflation and tight labor mar kets. That said, some central\nbanks also emphasized the need to be cautious in their approach, given the lags of monetar y\npolicy and the uncer tainty about the outlook for growth and inflation. The trade-w eighted exchange\nvalue of the U.S. dollar is a touch low er.\nMonetar y Policy\nIn response to high inflation, the FOMC continued to increase the target range for the federal\nfunds rate and reduce its securities holdings this year . Adjustments to both interest rates and the\nbalance sheet are pla ying a role in fir ming the stance of monetar y policy in suppor t of the F ederal\nReser ve\u2019s maximum-emplo yment and price-stability goals.\nInterest rate policy .The FOMC continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate,\nbringing it to the cur rent range of 5 to 5\u00bc percent. In light of the cumulative tightening of mon-\netary policy and the lags with which monetar y policy affects economic activity and inflation, the\nFOMC slow ed the pace of policy tightening relative to last year . The FOMC will deter mine meeting\nby meeting the extent of additional policy fir ming that ma y be appropriate to retur n inflation to\n2 percent o ver time, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook\nfor economic activity and inflation.Monetar y Policy and Economic De velopments 11Balance sheet policy .The F ederal Reser ve has continued the process of significantly reducing its\nholdings of T reasur y and agency securities in a predictable manner .4Beginning in June of last year ,\nprincipal pa yments from securities held in the System Open Mar ket Account (SOMA) ha ve been\nreinvested only to the extent that the y exceeded monthly caps.

This decrease in assets w as par tially\noffset b y liquidity pro visions to the banking system following the banking-sector stresses in March.\nSpecial T opics\nEmplo yment and ear nings across groups. Strong labor demand o ver the past two year s has par-\nticular ly benefited historically more disadvantaged wor kers. As a result, many of the disparities in\nemplo yment and w ages across racial, ethnic, sex, and education groups, which had been exacer-\nbated b y the pandemic, have nar rowed\u2014in some cases to historically nar row ranges. Despite this\nnarrowing , there remain significant disparities in absolute le vels of emplo yment and w ages across\ngroups.

Banking-sector strains in March 2023 repor tedly led to fur ther tightening in lending condi-\ntions at some banks. Results from the April 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur vey on Bank\nLending Practices show that banks expect to fur ther tighten their lending standards o ver the\nremainder of 2023, with some banks repor ting concer ns about their liquidity positions, deposit\noutflows, and funding costs. Economic research suggests that tighter credit conditions at banks\ncan ha ve adver se effects on economic activity , but different studies find effects that var y in scope,\nmagnitude, and timing . In ter ms of scope, the effects are also lik ely to differ across bor rowers,\neconomic sector s, and geographic areas, and the y may be larger for sector s that depend more\nheavily on bank credit, such as the commercial real estate and the small business sector s.

The labor mar ket remains relatively tight, with the unemplo yment rate\nnear historically low le vels and job vacancies still ele vated. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth\nhas also been strong , suppor ted by solid increases in consumer spending .\nThe FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5\u00bc to 5\u00bd percent since\nits July 2023 meeting . The Committee vie ws the policy rate as lik ely at its peak for this tightening\ncycle, which began in ear ly 2022. The F ederal Reser ve has also continued to reduce its holdings\nof Treasur y and agency mor tgage-back ed securities.\nAs labor mar ket tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achie ving the\nCommittee\u2019 s emplo yment and inflation goals ha ve been mo ving into better balance. Even so, the Com-\nmittee remains highly attentive to inflation risks and is acutely a ware that high inflation imposes signifi-\ncant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials.\nThe FOMC is strongly committed to retur ning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In considering an y\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it\nwill be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is\nmoving sustainably tow ard 2 percent.\n1Those complete repor ts are a vailable on the Board\u2019 s website at https://www .federalreser ve.go v/publications/files/\n20240301_mprfullrepor t.pdf (March 2024) and https://www .federalreser ve.go v/monetar ypolicy/files/\n20230616_mprfullrepor t.pdf (June 2023).\n2As required b y section 2B of the F ederal Reser ve Act, the Federal Reser ve Board submits written repor ts to the Congress\nthat contain discussions of \u201cthe conduct of monetar y policy and economic de velopments and prospects for the future. \u201d3Recent Economic and F inancial De velopments\nInflation. Consumer price inflation has slow ed notably but remains abo ve 2 percent. The price\nindex for per sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 2.4 percent o ver the 12 months ending in\nJanuar y, down from a peak of 7.1 percent in 2022. The core PCE price index\u2014which excludes\nvolatile food and energ y prices and is gener-\nally considered a better guide to the direction\nof future inflation\u2014rose 2.8 percent in the\n12 months ending in Januar y, and the slowing\nin inflation w as widespread across both goods\nand ser vices prices ( figure 2.1 ). More recently ,\ncore PCE prices increased at an annual rate of\n2.5 percent o ver the six months ending in\nJanuar y, though measuring inflation o ver rela-\ntively shor t periods risks exaggerating the\ninfluence of idiosyncratic or temporar y factor s.\nMeasures of longer-ter m inflation expectations\nare within the range of values seen in the\ndecade before the pandemic and continue to\nbe broadly consistent with the FOMC\u2019 s\nlonger-r un objective of 2 percent.\nThe labor mar ket.The labor mar ket has\nremained relatively tight, with job gains a ver-\naging 239,000 per month since June and the\nunemplo yment rate near historical lows\n(figure 2.2 ).

Upw ard pressure on asset valuations continued, with real estate prices ele vated relative to\nrents and high price-to-ear nings ratios in equity mar kets. Bor rowing from nonfinancial businesses\nand households continued to increase at a pace slow er than that of nominal GDP , and the com-\nbined debt-to-GDP ratio now sits close to its 20-year low. Vulnerabilities from financial-sector\nleverage remain notable. While risk-based bank capital ratios stayed solid and increased broadly,\ndeclines in the fair values of fixed-rate assets have been sizable relative to the regulatory capital\nat some banks. Meanwhile, leverage at hedge funds has stabilized at high levels, and leverage at\nlife insurers increased to values close to the historical averages but with a liability composition\nthat has become more reliant on nontraditional sources of funding. Most banks maintained high\nliquidity and stable funding, while bank funding costs continue to increase.

Following a rebound in ear ly 2023, growth in foreign economic\nactivity w as subdued in the second half of last year . Economic growth w as par ticular ly weak in\nadvanced foreign economies (AFEs) as monetar y policy tightening w eighed on activity and high\ninflation eroded real household incomes. Str uctural adjustment to higher energ y prices in Europe\ncontinued to hinder economic perfor mance, while proper ty-sector w eakness and sluggish domestic\ndemand restrained Chinese economic activity . Foreign headline inflation has fallen fur ther,\nreflecting declines in core and food inflation. How ever, the pace of disinflation has varied across\ncountries and sector s, with the moderation in goods inflation generally outpacing that in ser vices\ninflation.\nMost foreign central banks paused policy interest rate hik es in the second half of last year and\nhave since held rates steady . Policy rate paths implied b y financial mar ket pricing suggest that\ncentral banks in man y AFEs are expected to begin low ering their policy rates in 2024.

After significantly tightening the stance of monetar y policy since ear ly 2022,\nthe FOMC has maintained the target range for the policy rate at 5\u00bc to 5\u00bd percent since its\nmeeting last July ( figure 2.4 ). Although the FOMC judges that the risks to achie ving its emplo yment\nand inflation goals are mo ving into better balance, the Committee remains highly attentive to infla-\ntion risks. The Committee has indicated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the\ntarget range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is mo ving sustainably tow ard6 110th Annual Repor t | 20232 percent. In considering an y adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com-\nmittee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nBalance sheet policy .The F ederal Reser ve has continued the process of significantly reducing its\nholdings of T reasur y and agency securities in a predictable manner , contributing to the tightening\nof financial conditions.3Beginning in June 2022, principal pa yments from securities held in the\nSystem Open Mar ket Account ha ve been rein vested only to the extent that the y exceeded monthly\ncaps. Under this policy , the Federal Reser ve has reduced its securities holdings about $640 billion\nsince mid-June 2023, bringing the total reduction in securities holdings since the star t of balance\nsheet r unoff to about $1.4 trillion. The FOMC has stated that it intends to maintain securities\nholdings at amounts consistent with implementing monetar y policy efficiently and effectively in its\nample-reser ves regime.

Offsetting factor s boosting housing demand, such as the robust job\nmarket and the increased pre valence of remote wor k, have pre vented significant price declines.\nHigh mor tgage rates ha ve also discouraged some potential seller s with low rates on their cur rent\nmortgages from mo ving, which has k ept the existing home mar ket unusually thin. The shor tage of\navailable existing homes has pushed some remaining homebuyer s tow ard ne w homes and sup-\nported a modest rebound in constr uction of single-family homes later in 2023. In contrast, multi-\nfamily star ts rose to historically high le vels in 2022 but ha ve more recently fallen back because of\nbuilder s\u2019 concer ns about the effect of the significant amount of ne w multifamily supply on rents\nand proper ty prices.

Bringing inflation back to 2 percent will lik ely require a period of below-trend\ngrowth and some softening of labor mar ket conditions.\nIn response to high inflation, the FOMC continued to increase interest rates and reduce its securi-\nties holdings. The FOMC has raised the target range for the federal funds rate a fur ther 75 basis\npoints since the star t of the year , bringing the range to 5 to 5\u00bc percent. In deter mining the extent\nof additional policy fir ming that ma y be appropriate to retur n inflation to 2 percent o ver time, the\nFOMC indicated that it will tak e into account the cumulative tightening of monetar y policy , the lags\nwith which monetar y policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial\ndevelopments. The F ederal Reser ve also continued to reduce its holdings of T reasur y and agency\nmortgage-back ed securities; these holdings ha ve declined b y about $420 billion since Januar y, fur-\nther tightening financial conditions.\nThe F ederal Reser ve is acutely a ware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially\non those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials. The FOMC is strongly committed to\nreturning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic and F inancial De velopments\nInflation. Consumer price inflation, as measured b y the 12-month change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 4.4 percent in April, down from its peak of\n7.0 percent last June but still w ell abo ve the FOMC\u2019 s 2 percent objective. Core PCE price\ninflation\u2014which excludes volatile food and energ y prices and is generally considered a better\nguide to the direction of future inflation\u2014is also off its peak but w as still 4.7 percent o ver the\n12 months ending in April. As supply chain bottlenecks ha ve eased and demand has stabilized,\nincreases in core goods prices slow ed considerably o ver the past year . Within core ser vices prices,\nhousing ser vices inflation has been high, but the monthly changes ha ve star ted to ease in recent\nmonths, consistent with the slow er increases in rents for ne w tenants that ha ve been obser ved\nsince the second half of last year . For other core ser vices, price inflation remains ele vated and has\nnot shown signs of easing , and prospects for slowing inflation ma y depend in par t on a fur ther\neasing of tight labor mar ket conditions.

Labor demand has eased in man y sector s of the econom y but continues to exceed\nthe supply of a vailable wor kers, with job vacancies still ele vated. Labor supply has impro ved, with\na pickup in immigration and an impro vement in the labor force par ticipation rate, particular ly\namong prime-age wor kers. Nominal w age gains continued to slow in the fir st half of 2023, but the y\nremain abo ve the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation o ver the longer ter m, given pre vailing\ntrends in productivity growth.\nEconomic activity .After the strong rebound in 2021 from the pandemic-induced recession, eco-\nnomic activity lost momentum last year , and growth in the fir st quar ter of this year w as modest as\nfinancial conditions continued to tighten. Real consumer spending gre w at a solid pace in the fir st\nquarter but appear s to be moderating as consumer financing conditions ha ve tightened and con-\nsumer confidence has remained low . Real business fixed in vestment growth continued to slow in\nthe fir st quar ter, likely reflecting tighter financial conditions and w eaker output growth, while manu-\nfacturing output has been roughly unchanged so far this year after ha ving declined in the four th\nquarter. Activity in the housing sector continued to contract in response to ele vated mor tgage\nrates, but se veral indicator s appear to ha ve bottomed out.\nFinancial conditions. Financial conditions ha ve tightened fur ther since Januar y. The FOMC has\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate a fur ther 75 basis points since Januar y, and the\nmarket-implied expected path of the federal funds rate o ver the next year shifted up. Though yields\non longer-ter m nominal T reasur y securities w ere little changed, on net, over this period, the rela-\ntively high le vel of interest rates has w eighed on financing activity . Business loans at banks gre w\nsince the star t of 2023, but the pace of growth continued to slow as banks tightened standards\nand a verage bor rowing costs rose. In vestment-grade cor porate bond issuance rebounded to a\nbrisk pace in Ma y, following a slowdown in March and April. Speculative-grade issuance rebounded\nas well but w as still subdued b y historical standards. While business credit quality remains strong ,\nsome indicator s of future business defaults are some what ele vated. F or households, mortgage\noriginations remained w eak, although consumer loans (such as auto loans and credit cards) gre w\nfurther. After ha ving risen last year , delinquency rates le veled off in the fir st quar ter for auto loans\nand continued to increase for credit card loans.\nFinancial stability .Despite concer ns about profitability at some banks, the banking system\nremains sound and resilient. Most measures of valuation pressures in cor porate securities mar-\nkets remained near the middle of their historical distributions. By contrast, valuation pressures in10 110th Annual Repor t | 2023commercial and residential real estate mar kets continued to be ele vated. Bor rowing b y house-\nholds and businesses gre w a bit more slowly than GDP , leaving vulnerabilities arising from house-\nhold and business debt largely unchanged at moderate levels. In the banking sector, heavy reli-\nance on uninsured deposits, declining fair values of long-duration fixed-rate assets associated with\nhigher interest rates, and poor risk management led to the failure of three domestic banks. Broad\nbank equity prices fell sharply as market participants reassessed the strength of some banks with\nsimilar risk profiles to those that failed. However, the broader banking sector maintained substan-\ntial loss-absorbing capacity and ample liquidity. In the nonbank financial sector, leverage at hedge\nfunds remained elevated, and structural vulnerabilities associated with funding risk persisted at\nsome money market funds and certain mutual funds.

Following a slowdown at the end of 2022, foreign activity rebounded\nearly this year . This rebound w as driven in par t by strong growth in China, as the lifting of\nCOVID-19 restrictions unleashed pent-up demand, though recent indicator s suggest that\nmomentum is slowing . Europe show ed resilience to the energ y price shock stemming from Rus-\nsia\u2019s war against Ukraine. F oreign headline inflation continued to fall, driven b y declines in retail\nenerg y prices. How ever, while energ y inflation has moderated in man y foreign economies, both\nfood and core inflation remain ele vated.\nSince Januar y, several major foreign central banks continued tightening their monetar y policies,\ncommunicating concer ns about ele vated inflation and tight labor mar kets. That said, some central\nbanks also emphasized the need to be cautious in their approach, given the lags of monetar y\npolicy and the uncer tainty about the outlook for growth and inflation. The trade-w eighted exchange\nvalue of the U.S. dollar is a touch low er.\nMonetar y Policy\nIn response to high inflation, the FOMC continued to increase the target range for the federal\nfunds rate and reduce its securities holdings this year . Adjustments to both interest rates and the\nbalance sheet are pla ying a role in fir ming the stance of monetar y policy in suppor t of the F ederal\nReser ve\u2019s maximum-emplo yment and price-stability goals.\nInterest rate policy .The FOMC continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate,\nbringing it to the cur rent range of 5 to 5\u00bc percent. In light of the cumulative tightening of mon-\netary policy and the lags with which monetar y policy affects economic activity and inflation, the\nFOMC slow ed the pace of policy tightening relative to last year . The FOMC will deter mine meeting\nby meeting the extent of additional policy fir ming that ma y be appropriate to retur n inflation to\n2 percent o ver time, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook\nfor economic activity and inflation.Monetar y Policy and Economic De velopments 11Balance sheet policy .The F ederal Reser ve has continued the process of significantly reducing its\nholdings of T reasur y and agency securities in a predictable manner .4Beginning in June of last year ,\nprincipal pa yments from securities held in the System Open Mar ket Account (SOMA) ha ve been\nreinvested only to the extent that the y exceeded monthly caps.

Banking-sector strains in March 2023 repor tedly led to fur ther tightening in lending condi-\ntions at some banks.

Economic research suggests that tighter credit conditions at banks\ncan ha ve adver se effects on economic activity , but different studies find effects that var y in scope,\nmagnitude, and timing . In ter ms of scope, the effects are also lik ely to differ across bor rowers,\neconomic sector s, and geographic areas, and the y may be larger for sector s that depend more\nheavily on bank credit, such as the commercial real estate and the small business sector s.

These monitoring effor ts promote financial stability b y infor ming broader policy\ndiscussions and stimulating additional research.\nSome of these activities are also discussed else where in this annual repor t. A broader set of eco-\nnomic and financial de velopments are discussed in section 2 , \u201cMonetar y Policy and Economic\nDevelopments, \u201d with the discussion that follows concer ning sur veillance of economic and financial\ndevelopments focused on financial stability . The full range of activities associated with super vision\nof systemically impor tant financial institutions and designated financial mar ket utilities is dis-\ncussed in section 4 , \u201cSuper vision and Regulation. \u201d\n1For more infor mation on how the F ederal Reser ve promotes a stable financial system, see the section \u201cPromoting F inan-\ncial System Stability\u201d in The F ed Explained: What the Central Bank Does, available on the Board\u2019 s website at https://\nwww.federalreser ve.go v/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf#page=50 .15Monitoring F inancial V ulnerabilities\nThis section describes the F ederal Reser ve\u2019s monitoring of vulnerabilities in the financial system\nduring 2023.\nFinancial institutions are link ed together through a complex set of relationships, and their resil-\nience depends on the economic condition of households and businesses. In tur n, the condition of\nhouseholds and businesses hinges on the strength of financial institutions\u2019 balance sheets, as\nthe nonfinancial sector obtains funding through the financial sector . The F ederal Reser ve\u2019s meas-\nures to monitor risks to financial stability are designed to better under stand these complex link-\nages and ha ve been an impor tant par t of the F ederal Reser ve\u2019s effor ts to achie ve overall eco-\nnomic stability .\nA stable financial system, when hit b y adver se events, or \u201cshocks, \u201d is able to continue meeting\ndemands for financial ser vices from households and businesses, such as credit pro vision and pa y-\nment ser vices. By contrast, in an unstable system, these same shocks are lik ely to ha ve much\nlarger effects, disrupting the flow of credit and leading to declines in emplo yment and economic\nactivity .Figure 3.1. The F ederal Reser ve assesses four k ey vulnerabilities in monitoring financial stability\nEach quar ter, Federal Reser ve Board staff assess a set of four vulnerabilities rele vant for financial system stability .\nThese monitoring effor ts promote financial stability b y infor ming broader policy discussions and stimulating additional\nresearch.\nLeverage in the \n\ufb01nancial sector Funding risk Borrowing by businesses \nand households Asset valuations \nOvervalued assets \nare a vulnerability \nbecause the \nunwinding of high \nprices can be \ndestabilizing. Excessive borrowing \nby businesses and \nhouseholds leaves \nthem vulnerable to \ndistress if their \nincomes decline or \nthe assets they own \nfall in value. Excessive leverage \nwithin the \ufb01nancial \nsector increases the \nrisk that \ufb01nancial \ninstitutions will not \nhave the ability to \nabsorb even modest \nlosses when hit by \nadverse shocks. Funding risks expose \nthe \ufb01nancial system \nto the possibility \nthat investors will \n\u201crun\u201d by quickly \nwithdrawing their \nfunds from a \nparticular institution \nor sector. Why it matters: Why it matters: Why it matters: Why it matters: 16 110th Annual Repor t | 2023Consistent with this vie w of financial stability , the Federal Reser ve Board\u2019 s monitoring frame work\ndistinguishes betw een shocks to and vulnerabilities of the financial system. Shocks, such as\nsudden changes to financial or economic conditions, are inherently hard to predict. V ulnerabilities\ntend to build up o ver time and are the aspects of the financial system that are most expected to\ncause widespread problems in times of stress.\nAccordingly , the Federal Reser ve maintains a flexible, forward-looking financial stability monitoring\nprogram focused on assessing how the le vel and configuration of those vulnerabilities affect the\nfinancial system\u2019 s resilience to a wide range of potential adver se shocks.\nEach quar ter, Federal Reser ve Board staff assess a set of vulnerabilities rele vant for financial sta-\nbility, including , but not limited to, asset valuation pressures, borrowing b y households and busi-\nnesses, leverage in the financial sector , and funding risk. These monitoring effor ts infor m discus-\nsions concer ning policies to promote financial stability , such as super vision and regulator y policies\nas well as monetar y policy . They also infor m Federal Reser ve interactions with broader monitoring\nefforts, such as those b y the FSOC and the F inancial Stability Board (FSB).\nSince 2018, the Federal Reser ve Board has also published its Financial Stability Repor t,which\nsummarizes the Board\u2019 s frame work for assessing the resilience of the U.S. financial system and\npresents the Board\u2019 s current assessment of financial system vulnerabilities.2It aims to promote\npublic under standing about F ederal Reser ve vie ws on this topic and thereb y increase transparency\nand accountability . The repor t complements the annual repor t of the FSOC, which is chaired b y the\nSecretar y of the T reasur y and includes the F ederal Reser ve Chair and other financial regulator s.\nAsset V aluation Pressures\nOvervalued assets are a vulnerability because the unwinding of high prices can be destabilizing ,\nespecially if the assets are widely held and the values are suppor ted by excessive le verage, matur-\nity transfor mation, or risk opacity . Moreo ver, stretched asset valuations ma y be an indicator of a\nbroader buildup in risk-taking . Because it is ver y difficult to judge whether an asset price is o ver-\nvalued relative to fundamentals, the Federal Reser ve\u2019s analysis of asset valuation pressures typi-\ncally tracks a broad range of measures, including price volatility , underwriting standards, and\ninvestor flows.\nThe econom y remained strong o ver the year , and the economic outlook centered on continued\ngrowth. Against this backdrop, valuation pressures across different sector s remained notable.\n2See Board of Go vernors of the F ederal Reser ve System, Financial Stability Repor t(Washington: Board of Go vernors,\nApril 2024), https://www .federalreser ve.go v/publications/files/financial-stability-repor t-20240419.pdf ; and Board of\nGovernors of the F ederal Reser ve System, Financial Stability Repor t(Washington: Board of Go vernors, October 2023),\nhttps://www .federalreser ve.go v/publications/files/financial-stability-repor t-20231020.pdf .Financial Stability 17Equity prices w ere still high relative to ear n-\nings ( figure 3.2 ). In addition, real estate prices\ncontinued to be high relative to fundamentals.\nSpreads on cor porate bonds and loans ended\n2023 at le vels below those seen o ver most of\n2022 and 2023 and similar to the le vels seen\nin the late 2010s ( figure 3.3 ).\nValuation pressures in the residential real\nestate sector remained ele vated b y historical\nstandards. Despite high bor rowing costs and\ntightening of lending standards, various house\nprice indexes show ed increases o ver the year .\nThe price-to-rent ratio remained at the upper\nend of its historical distribution, suppor ted by\na tight in ventor y of homes for sale.\nCommercial real estate (CRE) prices remained\nhigh relative to fundamentals despite the con-\ntinued decline in prices in most segments.\nAmid low transaction volumes, transaction-\nbased prices ma y not fully reflect the deterio-\nration in CRE mar kets, because rather than\nrealizing losses, owner s could decide not to\nput their proper ties on the mar ket and instead\nchoose to w ait for more fa vorable conditions.\nFinally, farmland prices continued to increase,\nsuppor ted by high commodity prices and lim-\nited far mland in ventories.\nBorrowing b y Households and\nBusinesses\nExcessive bor rowing b y households and busi-\nnesses has been an impor tant contributor to\npast financial crises. When highly indebted\nhouseholds and nonfinancial businesses are hit b y negative shocks to incomes or asset values,\nthey may be forced to cur tail spending , which could then amplify the effects of financial shocks.Figure 3.2.

T otal debt\ndeclined o ver the year , even as nominal GDP\ncontinued to grow in 2023, leaving the credit-\nto-GDP ratio close to its low est le vel in\n20 year s (figure 3.4 ). This de velopment sug-\ngests that, in the aggregate, households and\nbusinesses do not appear to ha ve bor rowed\nexcessively .\nSeparate examination of business and house-\nhold bor rowing yields some additional\ninsights.

While risks associated with private credit from in vestor redemption and\nleverage appeared limited, the sector remains opaque, making it difficult to assess vulnerabilities.\nIn the household sector , household debt relative to GDP declined in 2023. Mor tgage debt\naccounts for roughly two-thirds of total household debt, with ne w mor tgage extensions sk ewed\ntoward prime bor rowers in recent year s. Most of the remaining one-third of household debt is\nconsumer credit, which consists primarily of student loans, auto loans, and credit card debt.\nAlthough the strength of households\u2019 balance sheets held up through 2023, credit card and auto\ndelinquency rates increased slightly . This increase w as lik ely due to the unwinding of pandemic\nsuppor t programs rather than a significant deterioration in lending standards, which remain con-\nservative. Student loan delinquencies w ere held down b y pandemic-related debt relief. Although\nthe extended pandemic forbearance has ended, the ne w forgiveness plan of a 12-month \u201con\nramp\u201d to repa yment and the ne w Saving on a V aluable Education plan could temper rising future\ndelinquencies.\nLeverage in the F inancial System\nThe banking sector remained sound and resil-\nient o verall in 2023.

How ever, life insurance companies\ncontinued to increase the share of assets allocated to risk y instr uments, which lea ves their capital\npositions vulnerable to declines in the value of their in vestments. Based on a number of meas-\nures, leverage at hedge funds during 2023 stabilized at an ele vated le vel as the T reasur y cash-\nfutures basis trade continued to grow , suggesting a risk of sudden dele veraging if volatility in\nTreasur y mar kets increases unexpectedly .\nFunding Risk\nOverall, banks\u2019 liquidity positions remained\nample based on the risk of their funding str uc-\ntures.

      "summary": "The partial document discusses several key points related to financial stability in 2023. It highlights the decline in corporate bond holdings by mutual funds following modest outflows and orderly management of net redemptions. It notes the significant size of stablecoin assets (~$125 billion), their potential risks to short-term funding markets, their role as cash substitutes in crypto trading, and concerns about regulatory oversight. The document details the Federal Reserve's domestic and international cooperation efforts to promote stability, focusing on the activities of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). FSOC\u2019s priorities in 2023 included nonbank financial intermediation, Treasury market resilience, climate-related financial risks, and digital assets, supported by various working groups analyzing hedge funds, nonbank mortgage servicers, Treasury market surveillance, and climate risks. FSOC also issued new analytical frameworks and guidance for overseeing nonbank financial companies. The council\u2019s annual report covered financial market developments, emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and recommendations across topics such as global economic conditions, household finance, market turmoil, and technological issues like quantum computing. Additionally, the document outlines the Federal Reserve's participation in the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates international financial stability policies and addressed issues like liquidity mismatches in funds, crypto-asset intermediaries, and nonbank financial intermediation resilience."

These organizations controlled 3,486 insured commercial banks\nand held approximately 95 percent of all insured commercial bank assets in the United States.\nBHCs that meet cer tain capital, managerial, and other requirements ma y elect to become financial\nholding companies (FHCs). FHCs can generally engage in a broader range of financial activities\nthan other BHCs. As of year-end 2023, a total of 502 domestic BHCs and 45 foreign banking orga-\nnizations had FHC status. Of the domestic FHCs, 23 had consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore; 62 betw een $10 billion and $100 billion; 191 betw een $1 billion and $10 billion; and\n226 less than $1 billion.\nSavings and Loan Holding Companies\nAt year-end 2023, a total of 287 sa vings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) w ere in operation,\nof which 148 w ere top-tier SLHCs.

The\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Cur rency (OCC) or the F ederal Deposit Insurance Cor poration\n(FDIC) is the primar y federal regulator for subsidiar y savings associations of SLHCs. Some SLHCs\nare engaged primarily in nonbanking activities, such as insurance underwriting (5 SLHCs) and com-\nmercial activities (4 SLHCs). The 25 largest SLHCs accounted for almost $1.3 trillion of total com-\nbined assets.\nAt year-end 2023, the Federal Reser ve super vised five companies that own depositor y institutions\nand are significantly engaged in insurance activities. All five of these institutions w ere SLHCs. As\nof December 31, 2023, they had approximately $425 billion in total assets. T wo of these fir ms\nhave total assets greater than $100 billion, and insured depositor y assets represent less than\nhalf of total assets for four of the five SLHCs.\nIn 2022, the Federal Reser ve proposed and finalized a super visory frame work for insurance orga-\nnizations that are o verseen b y the Board. The super visory frame work consists of a risk-based\napproach to super visory expectations and activities; a unique super visory ratings system; and reli-\nance, to the fullest extent possible, on the wor k perfor med b y other rele vant super visors, including\nthe state insurance regulator s.

As a result of these designations, the Board assumed an expanded set\nof responsibilities related to these designated FMUs that includes promoting unifor m risk-\nmanagement standards, playing an enhanced role in the super vision of designated FMUs, reducing\nsystemic risk, and suppor ting the stability of the broader financial system. F or cer tain designated\nFMUs, the Board established risk-management standards and expectations that are ar ticulated in\nthe Board\u2019 s Regulation HH.\nIn addition to setting minimum risk-management standards, Regulation HH establishes advance\nnotice requirements for proposed material changes to the r ules, procedures, or operations of a\ndesignated FMU for which the Board is the super visory agency under title VIII. F inally, Regula-\ntion HH also establishes minimum conditions and requirements for a F ederal Reser ve Bank to\nestablish and maintain an account for , and pro vide ser vices to, a designated FMU.1Where the\nBoard is not the title VIII super visory agency , the Federal Reser ve wor ks closely with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures T rading Commission to promote\nrobust FMU risk management and monitor systemic risks across the designated FMUs.\nInternational Activities\nForeign operations of U.S. banking organizations.
